## Node.JS Core Understanding

### What is Node.JS?

- Node.js is an open source server environment
- Node.js is free
- Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
- Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

### What problem does Node.JS solve?

Node.JS is trying to create a single ecosystem where all the components of an application be it fronted, backend, desktop app, mobile app can all be written in one language and that is Java Script.

Node.JS also provides flexibility, asynchronous calls, and the most importantly it can be made to behave both functional and object oriented as and when need arises (this property is basically due to JavaScript, but it can be put to many unique applications)

### What is the V8 Javascript Engine?

V8 is the name of the JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome. It's the thing that takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome.

V8 is the JavaScript engine i.e. it parses and executes JavaScript code. The DOM, and the other Web Platform APIs (they all makeup runtime environment) are provided by the browser.

The cool thing is that the JavaScript engine is independent of the browser in which it's hosted. This key feature enabled the rise of Node.js. V8 was chosen to be the engine that powered Node.js back in 2009, and as the popularity of Node.js exploded, V8 became the engine that now powers an incredible amount of server-side code written in JavaScript.

The Node.js ecosystem is huge and thanks to V8 which also powers desktop apps, with projects like Electron.

### Is Node.JS really necessary in the Development ecosystem?

Yes, Node.js made JavaScript a full-stack technology of choice for web application development.

### What is the difference between Node.JS and any other browser?

Both the browser and Node.js use JavaScript as their programming language.

Building apps that run in the browser is a completely different thing than building a Node.js application.

Despite the fact that it's always JavaScript, there are some key differences that make the experience radically different.

From the perspective of a frontend developer who extensively uses JavaScript, Node.js apps bring with them a huge advantage: the comfort of programming everything - the frontend and the backend - in a single language.

You have a huge opportunity because we know how hard it is to fully, deeply learn a programming language, and by using the same language to perform all your work on the web - both on the client and on the server, you're in a unique position of advantage.

### What is NVM and Why is it useful for Node.JS developers?

Node Version Manager (NVM) is a tool used to manage multiple active Node.js versions.

The Node.js platform, Node.js community of tools, and Node.js libraries are fast-moving targets â€“ what might work under one Node.js version is not guaranteed to work for another version of Node.js. Hence, users need ways to switch between multiple versions of Node.js

NVM allows users to:

Locally download any of the remote Long Term Support (LTS) versions of Node.js with a simple command.
Easily switch between multiple versions of Node.js, right from the command line.
Set up aliases to switch between different downloaded versions of Node.js with ease.

## Node.JS Module System

### What is a Javascript Module?
### Why are Javascript Modules necessary?
### What module standards are available in Node.JS?
### What are the differences between ESModules and CommonJS modules?
### Which types of modules exist in Node.JS?

## Node.JS Module System - Practice

## Client-Server Model

### What is a Server?
### Why is a Client?
### Is a server just another physical computer?

Why do we refer to a certain class of applications as Servers?
What is the difference?

### Is there any similarity between human communication and the client-server model?

### Is the client-server model applicable only to the Web?
Can you mention any other example of this model outside the Web?
